# My_first_python_project
This was my first project used in collage lab, this project is a simple number guessing game, where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess it.
The player is prompted to guess the number, and the game provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, at which point it displays the number of attempts.

This project is a simple introduction to Python programming and includes basic user input, conditional statements, loops, and random number generation. You can further enhance it by adding features like a limited number of guesses or a high score system.
